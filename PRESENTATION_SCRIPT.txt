WHAT I COMPLETED THIS SPRINT (60 seconds)

1. EDIT PRODUCT PAGE - BRAND NEW PAGE
   - Created a complete new page at /products/edit
   - Built a full form with fields for: product name, category, description, price, stock quantity, and availability status
   - Added image upload section for product photos
   - Implemented delete product button with confirmation
   - Added form validation for required fields
   - Styled with responsive CSS that matches our design system
   - Connected navigation - has "Back to Profile" link

2. EDIT PROFILE PAGE - ENHANCED EXISTING PAGE
   - Updated the existing profile page to make all fields editable
   - Added "Edit Profile" button that toggles edit mode on/off
   - Made these fields editable: full name, email, location, phone, and bio
   - Added Save and Cancel buttons that appear only in edit mode
   - Fields are disabled when not editing for clean display
   - Users can edit their name directly in the header section

3. CONNECTED THE NAVIGATION
   - Added "Edit" buttons to every product card in the catalog
   - All edit buttons link to the edit product form
   - Navigation flows smoothly between pages


WHAT'S STILL IN PROGRESS (30 seconds)

The forms are complete on the frontend, but they need backend connection:

- Set up MongoDB Atlas database to store the data
- Create Next.js API routes in src/app/api folder for profile and products
- Add environment variables in Vercel for database connection
- Connect the forms to the API so data actually saves

Right now the forms show success alerts, but don't persist data yet. That's the next phase of this ongoing project.



I successfully delivered two working edit pages with full forms, validation, and styling. They're deployed and ready - just waiting for backend integration to make the data persist.

Thank you!
